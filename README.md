Everykid who grow up in the golden age of Arcade game still remember the sound of Pong when it is being played in those old school tv with just black and white color. In addition to being one of the original game that put Atari on the map, it is a better part of my childhood. Therefore I want to recreate Pong for this first project in my portfolio. PONG is going to be dope!!!
